For this project, the goal was to create a working chatbot that could converse with the user. The chatbot used a list of mirror words to mirror certain user responses. If there were no responses to mirror, the chatbot would echo a random response. This conversation format repeats for a given number of converstation rounds prompted from the user. Some special cases for punctuation and capitalization of mirror words have nto yet been added.
