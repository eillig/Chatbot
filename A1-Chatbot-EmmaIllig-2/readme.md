I found this assingment both a wonderful learning experience and quite frustrating. One of the main differences between python and java that I found difficult was how java deals with errors. Because java is a compiler language, it simply returns mulitple errors throughout the prgram instead of giving a specific line and description of the error. HTis made it much harder to debug and troubleshoot. Additonally, I'm still learning the new synax of java. I spend a few hours wondering why my code didn't work before discovering that there was different equivalence syntax in pythong and java. I found the inital input and transcript section of the assignment straightforward, but was stucm for a while on repalcing the mirror words as the find and replace string method did not work. 
On this assignment, I consulted with Venus Nguyen and Emma Sadle in class regarding this assignment. They gave me helpful feedback while I was in the planning stage. I was a little overwhelemed at the beginning and I was sure where to start so they helped me get a framework set up. I also worked with Maryam Shad throughout the project. We dubugged together and she helped me learn some of the syntax I couldn't figure out. 
Finally, I consuled codeacademy for some java synax tips and attended TA hours monday and tuesday night.
